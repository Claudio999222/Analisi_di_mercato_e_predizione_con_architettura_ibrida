# Hybrid Architecture for Market Analysis and Price Prediction

## Overview

This notebook focuses on combining traditional market analysis techniques with machine learning to predict stock prices using a hybrid architecture. The primary goal is to leverage both quantitative indicators and historical price data to improve the accuracy of stock price predictions.

## Key Components and Concepts:

1. **Market Analysis**: Incorporate traditional market analysis techniques, including fundamental analysis and technical analysis, to extract relevant features for predicting stock prices.

2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather historical price data and perform necessary preprocessing steps, such as cleaning data, handling missing values, and normalizing features.

3. **Hybrid Architecture**: Design a hybrid architecture that combines traditional market indicators with machine learning models. For instance, use quantitative indicators as input features for machine learning algorithms.

4. **Machine Learning Models**: Implement machine learning models, such as regression or time-series forecasting models, to predict stock prices based on the selected features.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Define appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the hybrid architecture. Common metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or others depending on the specific requirements.

6. **Visualization**: Visualize the predicted stock prices against actual prices to understand the model's performance and identify potential areas of improvement.

7. **Iterative Improvement**: Iteratively refine the hybrid architecture, adjust features, and fine-tune machine learning models to enhance predictive capabilities.

## Application:

- **Enhanced Predictions**: By combining traditional market analysis with machine learning, the hybrid architecture aims to provide more accurate and robust predictions of stock prices.

- **Feature Engineering**: Utilize a combination of quantitative indicators, technical indicators, and other relevant features for building a comprehensive set of predictors.

- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously refine the hybrid architecture based on feedback, market changes, and the model's performance to adapt to dynamic market conditions.

By the end of this notebook, the goal is to have a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates traditional market analysis insights with machine learning to make more accurate predictions of stock prices.
